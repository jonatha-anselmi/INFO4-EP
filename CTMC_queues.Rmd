### Problem statement

The aim of this session is to practice with continuous-time Markov chain and queues in R. We will write some code to simulate the dynamics associated to basic queueing systems.

#### Assumptions

Jobs arrive to the queueing systems following a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$ and their service times are random variables that follow a exponential distribution.


### M/M/1

We start by simulating the number of jobs in a M/M/1 queue. To do:

1. Draw the transition diagram on a piece of paper.

2. Plot a sample trajectory of the number of jobs

3. Print the average number of jobs in the systems, say $Q_{sim}$.

4. Compare $Q_{sim}$ with its theoretical formula.

Also, assume that service times have mean $1/\mu$.

```{r eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# This function performs the required simulation.

N=1e3; # overall number of events (departure or arrivals)

lambda=0.7; mu=1; # arrival and service rates

state=0; # set the initial state
Qsim=0;  # average number of jobs in the system

trajectory=c();
events=c();
for (i in 1:N) {

    # which events can occur? when?
    time_2_next_arr=rexp(1,lambda);
    time_2_next_dep=rexp(1,mu);
    trajectory=c(trajectory, state);
    if(state>0) {
        
        Qsim=Qsim+min(time_2_next_dep,time_2_next_arr)*state;
        events=c(events, min(time_2_next_dep,time_2_next_arr));
        
        if (time_2_next_dep<time_2_next_arr) {
            # a departure occurred
             state=state-1;
        } else {
             # an arrival occurred
             state=state+1;
        }
    } else {
        Qsim=Qsim+time_2_next_arr*state; # useless because state==0
        events=c(events, time_2_next_arr);
        state=state+1;    
    }
    
} #for

rho=lambda/mu;
cat("Average number of jobs (simulation) =  ", Qsim/sum(events),'\n');
cat("Average number of jobs (theory)     =  ", rho/(1-rho),'\n');

plot(cumsum(events),trajectory, type = 'S')
```
