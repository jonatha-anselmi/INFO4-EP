##### Install R and Rstudio
If you're running a debian or an ubuntu,
simply follow the following steps (otherwise, e.g., MacOS X or
Windows, you may want to have a look at [these
guidelines](https://gitlab.inria.fr/learninglab/mooc-rr/mooc-rr-ressources/-/blob/master/module2/ressources/rstudio_fr.org)):

``` shell
sudo apt-get install r-base r-cran-knitr r-cran-tidyverse
```
	
Installing software through your OS package manager is generally
the preferred way to do, although packages can also be installed
from R itself. Make sure you have a recent (>= 3.2.0) version or R. For example,
here is what I have on my machine:
	
``` shell	
R --version
```

    R version 3.5.2 (2018-12-20) -- "Eggshell Igloo"
    Copyright (C) 2018 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
    Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)

    R is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
    You are welcome to redistribute it under the terms of the
    GNU General Public License versions 2 or 3.
    For more information about these matters see

If it's not the case, it may be because you're running an old debian
stable or an old LTD ubuntu. In such case, you may want to [include
testing
packages](http://serverfault.com/questions/22414/how-can-i-run-debian-stable-but-install-some-packages-from-testing)... Ask
your local linux guru or run a VM if you're affraid to break your
OS. For the braves, let's keep going!

Rstudio and knitr are unfortunately not packaged within debian so
the easiest is to download the corresponding debian package on the
[Rstudio webpage](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop)
and then to install it manually (depending on when you do this,
you should obviously change the version number and you may have to
update the url so that it matches your OS).

``` shell
cd /tmp/
wget https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/bionic/amd64/rstudio-1.3.1073-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i rstudio-1.3.1073-amd64.deb
sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get -f install # to fix possibly missing dependencies
```

You may have trouble when installing some R packages. If so, try to
install these ones:

``` shell
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev
```

Finally you should be able to open rstudio. Try then to open a new
RMarkdown document (in the menu File New File R Markdown. When
doing so and depending on what has been installed on your machine,
Rstudio may complain that it requires upgraded versions of knitr,
rmarkdown and tinytex... :( Just proceed and you'll be ready for the
practical session.

## [15-01-2021] Practical Session 1

The objective is to write together a code in R that simulates the dynamics of a G/G/1 queue and then to use this code to estimate performance metrics such as the average time spent in the system by jobs as a function of the input parameters (e.g., job arrival and service rates).
